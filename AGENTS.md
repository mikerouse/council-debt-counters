## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This plugin provides shortcode-driven **animated counters** that visualise public finance data (e.g. council debt) for individual UK local authorities. It is designed for **activists, campaigners, journalists, councillors, and civic tech developers** who want to embed live, meaningful financial data into WordPress websites in a user-friendly and visually compelling way.

## ðŸ”§ Architectural Principles

This plugin is built around the following key principles, which all contributors must follow:

### âœ… **A**ccessibility
- Ensure that all UI elements are accessible (ARIA tags, high contrast modes, tab focus).
- Counters should work with JS disabled (fallback static value).

### âœ… **G**eneral Purpose & Portable
- Plugin should work on any standard WordPress install without dependency on bespoke themes or frameworks.
- All data (e.g. per-council debt figures) must be configurable via the WordPress admin interface.
- Avoid hardcoded URLs, inline SQL, or site-specific hacks.

### âœ… **E**xtensibility
- All counter types (e.g. debt, tax per household, interest) should use a modular shortcode handler structure.
- Developers should be able to register new counter types with minimal boilerplate.

### âœ… **N**ative WordPress Compliance
- Follow WordPress Plugin Handbook guidelines: 
  - Use WordPress Settings API
  - Use `wp_enqueue_script` and `wp_enqueue_style` properly
  - Namespace functions, classes, and options to avoid conflicts
  - Prepare for translation (`__()`, `_e()`, etc.)

### âœ… **T**heming & Style
- All styling should be implemented using **Bootstrap 5**, ideally using Bootstrap utility classes where possible.
- Animations must be **smooth digit transitions** (not whole-number jumps).
- Allow theme overrides via class names and filter hooks where appropriate.

### âœ… **S**eparation of Concerns
- Follow **object-oriented design** with a clear directory and file structure:

- /includes/
- - class-counter-manager.php
- - class-shortcode-renderer.php
- - class-settings-page.php
- - class-data-loader.php
- /admin/
- views/
- js/
- css/
- /public/
- - js/
- - css/


## ðŸ§© Features Planned

- `[council_counter]` shortcode (with arguments like `type=debt`, `council="Redditch"`, etc.)
- Admin panel for:
- Uploading CSV of base figures
- Overriding individual council data manually
- Setting animation preferences (tick speed, rounding, digit format)
- Smooth JS animation using `requestAnimationFrame` or lightweight libraries
- Optional charts using Chart.js (or similar) for trends
- Bootstrap UI components (cards, tooltips, badges, tables) for presenting supplementary data

## ðŸ“¦ Plugin Compatibility Targets

- WordPress 5.8+
- PHP 7.4+ (ideally PHP 8+ tested)
- Compatible with Elementor, Classic Editor, and Full Site Editing
- Zero dependency on jQuery (optional polyfill support only)

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions

We welcome pull requests that:
- Improve performance or accessibility
- Extend shortcode types or admin UI functionality
- Fix bugs or enhance code clarity

Please respect the above design patterns, submit pull requests with clear commit messages, and include inline comments where appropriate.
